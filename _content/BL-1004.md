## Project Overview

I set out to create a home network cloud service using the skills I have developed in the pursuit of my cloud administration certifications

The rack is composed of 5 Raspberry Pis and runs Kubernetes with MetalLB to evenly distribute the workload between nodes.

### In Progress

As of now the rack is not finished but does successfully host a local ad-blocker, a vpn for accessing the adblocker away from the home network, and a cloud photo vault to access photos without paying for hosted cloud storage
