## Introduction

### About Me

During the pandemic, I decided to take up running as a way to get fresh air and exercise without exposing myself to others. I had never been much of a runner; in fact, I had always despised it. Every time I had tried to do it as part of a team, I found myself performing terribly, which is probably why I disliked it. However, I found some comfort later in running by myself, both as a use of time and as a meditative state.

At first, running was quite difficult. Although I ran every day, I could barely go for a mile without turning back and calling it a day. I got stuck in the mindset that I was inherently bad at it, a belief I had held for a while.

At this point in my life, I had just started my gap year at Oregon State University, which was brought forth in no small part by the pandemic. My path was no longer clear. I had not been doing well in college and was on the verge of dropping out completely. Return to university, go to trade school, simply find a job? So many choices were in front of me, yet no obvious answer presented itself. I used the gap year to enter the workforce and decide for myself what my future would hold.

### Running: As It Relates to Mindset

I started to average about 5 miles per day, yet I could not run the whole distance without frequent breaks. My goal was to run the entire distance straight and then work from there. This took more time than I thought it would, and I was not really improving, which frustrated me. I needed a new approach.

Instead of telling myself to run the full distance at once, I divided it into smaller segments: run one mile straight, then two miles, and so on. This improved my rate of success, but I still found myself falling short of improvement. I would be climbing a large hill and could never make it to the top. That was when I realized that my goals were too arbitrary. A mile straight is a good goal, but it does not factor in the individual achievements within that mile: running the whole block, going from the bottom to the top of a hill, reaching a landmark. I stopped looking at my GPS tracker and instead developed internal goals: "If I can run this whole fence," "If I can make it to this cross street on the hill," "If I can make it to that streetlight." These mini and visible goals drastically improved my performance. Whereas before I might be tempted to slow down early, seeing these tangible goals gave me inspiration to hold out a bit longer. Over time, the goals became more lofty. I found myself going further and faster than I had been for months, improving at a rapid rate.

I had broken myself out of my defeatist mindset; no longer were goals outside of my reach.

In my time running, I have formed the belief that running is mostly a mindset. Listening to pumped-up music, setting goals, and cheering myself on for reaching them had a profound effect on my mind and performance. Even now, as I do not run nearly as much, I feel less defeated when I cannot run a whole hill or fail to hit a certain split. I still employ these same mental tricks to improve my perspective on running.

## The Value of Goal Setting

Goal setting has profound implications beyond just running. When trying to accomplish a task that seems herculean, there will always be that voice in your head that claims you cannot do it. To counter this, it is important to set achievable goals that you know you can accomplish. It is easy to say, "I cannot run a marathon; therefore, it is out of my reach," but it is hard to say, "I cannot run to the end of my block; therefore, it is out of my reach." Creating goals that are not only achievable but also quantifiable, visible, and motivated is the key to achieving larger goals.

### Achievable

A goal is achievable if it is within your realm to do it. I don't know if my body can ever run a mile in less than 4 minutes, but I do know I can at least jog the mile slowly. Setting these temporary sub-goals helps motivate you; they divide a huge task into smaller tasks that you can reward yourself for completing. Maybe you cannot create the next big app at your current skill level, but you can follow tutorials to build a calculator app to start. When I was running, I made sure not to get overzealous and set goals like "I will run the next 5 miles without stopping." Even later, when I had some confidence that this was possible, this was too shaky of a goal. Even if a goal is theoretically achievable, you will still benefit from ensuring the goal is definitely achievable. If I wanted to run the full 5 miles, I would set goals like, "I am going to run to that old house on the corner without stopping," then after I achieved that, I would set my next goal of "I am going to run to the park a couple of blocks down without stopping." This line of thinking will end up the same as "I will run 5 miles without stopping," but it is broken up into more achievable segments that will be more approachable.

### Quantifiable

A goal is quantifiable if you can measure your success. "Running fast" or "Coding well" are not quantifiable goals as you have no way to measure if you have succeeded. Instead, "Running a mile in 8 minutes" or "Coding a calculator that does not crash when you divide by zero" are goals that you can measure. In my goals with running, I set sub-goals of "run up the hill to that cross street without stopping." This goal is very easy to evaluate as to whether I accomplished it. If I had said "I will run most of the way up the hill without stopping," this can seem quantifiable, but it leaves enough ambiguity to where even if I ran fifty-one percent of the way up, I may still feel like I failed. It is important to set hard goals with as little ambiguity as possible.

How do you measure success in your goals? What tools or methods do you use?

### Visible

A goal is visible if you can see where it is in relation to you. Goals that you can see yourself progressing towards are important as they help motivate you to reach them. Going back to my landmarking while running strategy: you may not know how much further you have left in a mile, but you can see an upcoming tree and visualize that distance in your head. This makes you far less likely to give up as you can see how close you are to the goal. Even goals that are hard and quantifiable, like "running a mile without stopping," can be hard to achieve because you may not have a landmark for a mile. Instead, it is important to ensure that you have goal posts that are visible to you, even if that means setting a rock down on the mile line.

Do you have a visual representation of your goals? How do you track your progress?

### Motivated

A goal is motivated if you want to achieve it. This is probably the most important aspect. If a goal does not appeal to you, then you will have trouble achieving it. Imagine your family signs you up for a youth soccer league, but you have absolutely no desire to play the game. You will probably never reach a high level as it is not in your best interest. It is important to evaluate your goals to make sure they are, in fact, something you want. I have struggled with this aspect of goal setting many times; it is very difficult to know if you are doing something because you want it or because you think you want it. It is important to have moments of introspection to evaluate your goals.

What motivates you to achieve your goals? How do you stay inspired and driven?

### Reflection

After you have completed a goal, it is important to take a moment to reflect on your achievement. When you complete a goal, bask in it and say to yourself, "I am proud that I accomplished that goal." A pitfall of goal setting is moving the goal before you reach it. Make sure that once you set a goal, even if you realize it will be easier to achieve than you thought, do not retroactively make it harder. Instead, complete it as you would have and create a new one.

How do you celebrate your achievements? Do you have a reflection practice?

## Set Your Goals and Transform Your Mindset

Now that you understand the value of setting achievable, quantifiable, visible, and motivated goals, it's time to put this knowledge into practice. Whether you're aiming to improve your physical fitness, learn a new skill, or advance in your career, goal setting can be a powerful tool to help you reach your potential.

- Identify Your Goals: Start by writing down a list of things you want to achieve. Be specific about what you want and why it matters to you.

- Break Them Down: Divide larger goals into smaller, manageable tasks. Make sure each task is achievable, quantifiable, and visible. For example, if you want to learn a new language, set a goal to learn and use five new words each day.

- Stay Motivated: Choose goals that excite and inspire you. Reflect regularly on your progress and celebrate your achievements, no matter how small. This will help keep you motivated and committed.

- Monitor Your Progress: Keep track of your goals and review them regularly. Adjust your approach as needed, and don't be afraid to set new goals as you accomplish others.

- Reflect and Adjust: After achieving a goal, take a moment to reflect on your accomplishment. Recognize the effort you put in and the progress you've made. Use this reflection to set even more ambitious goals.

I challenge you to take the first step today. Pick one goal you've been putting off and apply these principles. Share your progress and experiences with others to stay accountable and inspired. Remember, every small step forward is a victory in itself.

Transform your mindset and unlock your potential through the power of goal setting. You have the tools and the mindset to achieve great things—now go out there and make it happen!

Achieving goals is not just about the end result; it's about the journey and the mindset you cultivate along the way. By setting achievable, quantifiable, visible, and motivated goals, you can create a roadmap for success that keeps you inspired and on track. Remember to celebrate your successes, reflect on your progress, and keep pushing forward. Your potential is limitless when you adopt a goal-oriented mindset.
