## Project Overview

I am designing and programming an indie game using the Unity engine. This game is a survival horror experience set in the unforgiving expanse of space. Drawing heavy inspiration from games like Darkwood, Duskers, and FTL, it combines elements of exploration, strategy, and survival in a top-down perspective.

The game focuses on engineering and resource management. The player's ship is controlled via a terminal console, reminiscent of retro computing interfaces. This terminal allows players to manage ship systems, monitor system health, and interact with the environment in a deeply immersive way.

The primary objective is to explore the cosmos, find, and document alien life forms. However, resources are scarce, and space is fraught with dangers. Players must navigate environmental hazards, repair broken machinery, combat alien pathogens, and overcome other challenges that threaten their mission's success.

## Current Progress

### Basic Movement

Significant strides have been made in developing the core mechanics of player movement and interaction. Currently, the player can:

- Move in all directions with smooth, responsive controls.

- Aim and turn to face different directions.

- Interact with objects within the game world, laying the foundation for more complex interactions and gameplay mechanics.

### Basic Terminal

A crucial feature of the game, the in-game terminal, has been implemented with essential functionality:

- Dynamic Directory System: The terminal uses a simple file parsing system to dynamically build and navigate directories, providing a realistic computing experience.

- Vim-Inspired Text Editor: Development is underway for a text editor inspired by the Vim text editor. This tool will allow players to edit system files, input commands, and manage their ship's functions directly through the terminal.

## Development Insights

### Inspiration and Design Philosophy

The game's design is rooted in the desire to blend the suspense and tension of survival horror with the strategic depth of resource management. The top-down perspective offers a unique vantage point, emphasizing the isolation and vulnerability of space exploration. By using a terminal console for ship control, the game aims to evoke a sense of nostalgia while providing a fresh and challenging gameplay mechanic.

### Challenges and Solutions

Developing an indie game presents numerous challenges, from technical hurdles to creative decisions. Some of the key challenges faced so far include:

- Creating Immersive Gameplay: Ensuring the terminal console is both functional and engaging requires careful balancing of complexity and usability. Iterative testing and player feedback will be crucial in refining this aspect.
- Balancing Resource Management: Crafting a resource management system that is challenging yet fair is a delicate process. Continuous adjustments are being made to resource scarcity and the impact of player decisions to maintain balance and tension.

### Future Plans
As development progresses, several key areas will be the focus:

- Expanded Terminal Functionality: Enhancing the terminal with more commands, interactive scripts, and deeper integration with the game's systems.
- Environmental Hazards and Alien Life: Developing diverse environmental hazards and alien life forms that will interact with the player and the ship's systems in unpredictable ways.
- Narrative Development: Crafting a compelling story that draws players into the world, with rich lore and engaging missions.
